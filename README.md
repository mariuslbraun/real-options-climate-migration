This repo contains R code as well as the [dataset](prepared/Dataset_final.csv) used for the empirical analysis of the research paper "A Real-Options Analysis of Climate Change and International Migration", published in *Environment and Development Economics* (Braun 2023).
In the paper, semiparametric regression models are used to investigate nonlinear effects of climate change on international migration.

Follow these steps to replicate the results of the paper:

## 1. Setting up the R environment

First, open the R project file [Real_Options_Climate_Migration.Rproj](Real_Options_Climate_Migration.Rproj) in RStudio. It is important to work in the R project, as it is associated with the directory that the project is located in and will set the working directory accordingly.
After opening the R project, open [setup.R](setup.R). Running the file will set up an R environment using the `renv` package, which manages project-local R dependencies to ensure that existing data analysis workflows work as they did before;
for more information see https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

Proceed as follows:

1. Call `options(repos = c(REPO_NAME = "https://packagemanager.rstudio.com/all/2022-08-01+Y3JhbiwyOjQ1MjYyMTU7RTY0MEEyRTM"))`
to load the CRAN snapshot from RStudio Package Manager. This will freeze to the R packages as they were available at the time that the analysis was conducted.

2. Install `renv` by calling `install.packages("renv")`.

3. Call `renv::init()` to initialize a new project-local environment with a private R library.
`bare = TRUE`: instead of installing dependencies automatically, we install packages manually.

4. Install the required packages.

5. Call `renv::snapshot()` to save the state of the project library.

The state of the library is saved in the [renv.lock](renv.lock) file.

## 2. Descriptive statistics

[Real_Options_Climate_Migration_Descriptive_Statistics.R](scripts/Real_Options_Climate_Migration_Descriptive_Statistics.R) produces descriptive statistics and density plots of the main variables for low- and middle-income countries.
In addition, t-tests comparing low- and middle-income sample means for the main variables are provided.

## 3. Main Results

[Real_Options_Climate_Migration_Results.R](scripts/Real_Options_Climate_Migration_Results.R) produces the main results of the paper. Separate data frames are created for low- and middle-income countries, and all
models are estimated separately for low- and middle-income countries.
The general workflow is the same for all of the regression models:

1.  The regression formula is stored as string `baseline_formula_gam` to be pasted into the model call.

2. `gc()` cleans up the R memory.

3. `gam_total = mgcv::gam(baseline_formula_gam, ...)` estimates a generalized additive model (GAM) using the `mgcv` package (Wood 2001). The estimation of the GAMs is quite computationally expensive,
and depending on the model, this may take up to a few hours to execute (hence the `tic()` and `toc()` commands surrounding the model call).

4. Next, plots of the smooth nonparametric functions of temperature and precipitation anomalies estimated by the models are produced:
```
# plot smooth nonparametric functions of temperature and precipitation anomalies
plot(gam_total, shade = TRUE, xlab = "Temperature anomalies", ylab = "", cex.lab = 1.4, cex.axis = 1.3)
# label y-axis
title(ylab = "log of bilateral migration rates", mgp=c(2.5,1,0), cex.lab = 1.4)
plot(gam_total, shade = TRUE, xlab = "Precipitation anomalies", ylab = "", cex.lab = 1.4, cex.axis = 1.3)
# label y-axis
title(ylab = "log of bilateral migration rates", mgp=c(2.5,1,0), cex.lab = 1.4)
# add axes to plot
abline(h=0, v=0, lty=2)
```

5. `gam.check(gam_total)` produces diagnostic information about the fitting procedure and results.

Proceed analogously for all other models.

## 4. Robustness Checks

[Real_Options_Climate_Migration_Robustness_Checks.R](scripts/Real_Options_Climate_Migration_Robustness_Checks.R) produces a host of robustness checks of the main results.
The general workflow for the models is identical to the one outlined for the main results.
